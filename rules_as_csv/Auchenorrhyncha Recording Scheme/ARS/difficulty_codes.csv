1,Can be identified in the field by anyone with a bit of experience. Species which beginners can rapidly learn to identify. Usually identifiable from a photo. Records acceptable from most sources.
2,Can be identified in the field with care and experience. Needs a good view or capture followed by examination with a good quality lens. Beginners should take voucher specimens until they gain familiarity and experience. May be identifiable from a good photo. Records acceptable from competent recorders.
3,"Species that require examination of external characters (including externally visible genitalia structures) under a microscope with good lighting, but where identification is then relatively straightforward.  May apply to females of species in which identification of males is easier. Identification accepted from experienced recorders (unless season, region or habitat is unusual), but less experienced ones would be expected to provide a specimen."
4,"Species that are difficult to identify, often requiring dissection (although identification may not be conclusive in females). All except very experienced recorders could be expected to provide a specimen, particularly if the record is outside the known season or geographic range of the species."
5,"Species that can only be identified following critical assessment, usually involving dissection and microscopic examination of genitalia. A specimen should always be retained for confirmation. May require consultation of specialist literature or comparison with verified reference material. Identification needs confirmation by a national expert. Even experienced recorders should seek a second opinion."
