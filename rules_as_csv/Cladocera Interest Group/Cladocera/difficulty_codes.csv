3,Water fleas (Cladocera) are very small and identifying them requires experience and the use of a high powered microscope. Photographs may be useful to verify records but must be taken through a microscope. Please record unidentified water fleas as Cladocera (not as Daphnia as this is just one group of water fleas).
