1,Can be identified in the field by anyone with some experience of microlepidoptera provided the moth is in good condition. Species with which the beginner readily becomes familiar. Usually identifiable from a reasonable quality photograph.
2,"Can be identified in the field with care and experience provided the moth is in good condition. Needs a good view or the netting of a specimen to check, but the moth can then be released. Beginners will usually need to retain a specimen or take a good quality photograph until they gain familiarity with the species. Usually identifiable from a good photograph. Worn specimens may require dissection."
3,"Specimen needs checking with hand lens or microscope in good light (e.g. exercise caution identifying whilst out light trapping at night). Provided the moth is in good condition, the Recording Scheme would accept records from experienced recorders unless the date, region or habitat was unusual. Beginners should get specimens checked at first until they gain experience.  Worn specimens will require dissection."
4,A voucher specimen should be retained and a genitalia dissection carried out unless the moth has been bred from a known larval food-plant for that species or the recorder is experienced and familiar with the species (this experience often gained by confirming identifications by dissection).  Non-bred specimens found away from familiar areas should be retained and dissected unless an good quality photograph of a specific critical identification feature is made available for examination - e.g. the white antennal tip in Monochra tenebrella females.
5,Voucher specimen should be retained. The Recording Scheme would require confirmation in the majority of cases - e.g. specimen having been verified by an acknowledged expert.
