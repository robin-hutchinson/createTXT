1,"Generally distinctive species unlikely to be confused with other species. Records usually accepted within the normal flight period or geographical range; otherwise one or more good quality photographs, or possibly a specimen, may be required. Applies to species which will quickly become familiar to those gaining experience."
2,"Can be confused with other species. Should not present any difficulty for experienced recorders; however, good quality photographs or a specimen will be required if the recorder is not familiar with the species, and experienced recorders may be expected to provide additional evidence if the species record is outside of the normal flight period or geographical range. Worn specimens (esp. micro-moths) are likely to be unidentifiable unless a specimen is retained for microscopic examination."
3,Very scarce species or species that are difficult to identify. A voucher specimen may be required by your County Recorder (seek advice before releasing the moth) particularly if the species record is outside of the normal flight period or geographical range. A good set of photographs showing all critical identification features clearly may suffice in some cases.
4,Species that can only be identified following critical assessment often involving dissection and examination of genitalia. A specimen should be retained for confirmation.
5,Ungraded.
